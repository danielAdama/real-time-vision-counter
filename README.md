# real-time-vision-counter
Developed a system that utilizes a deep learning pre-trained model (Caffe face detector) to detect faces, assign counts (IDs), and track individual persons as they move in real-time using OpenCV, Caffe, Spacy, Numpy, etc. 
The project counts how many people pass through a certain location.
